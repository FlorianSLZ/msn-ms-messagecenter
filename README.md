# MCD — M365 Change Digest

**Every Microsoft 365 change, in one place.**

A free, 100% client-side dashboard that tracks every Microsoft 365 change and lays it out clearly — filter by **product**, **status**, **release phase**, **cloud** and **platform**, search instantly, and follow a **release timeline per product**.

Built from Microsoft's **public Microsoft 365 roadmap** (~1,800+ changes across 37 products) and — optionally — your own tenant's **Message Center** via Microsoft Graph. The index is refreshed **daily** by a GitHub Action and deployed on **Cloudflare Pages**.

## What it is

Microsoft ships a relentless stream of M365 changes, scattered across the roadmap and the Message Center. MCD collapses that into one fast, readable dashboard:

- **Timeline per product** — a release schedule for each product, laid out across calendar quarters and colour-coded by status.
- **Faceted filters** — combine product, status (In development / Rolling out / Launched), release phase, platform and cloud. Counts update live; every view is shareable by URL.
- **Instant search** — type any feature, product or keyword and MCD ranks matching changes across the whole index (typo- and acronym-tolerant).
- **Status at a glance** — availability and preview dates surface right on each card; click for the full description and a link to the source.
- **100% client-side PWA** — the whole index ships with the page, nothing is sent anywhere, installable and works offline.

## Data sources

MCD combines two sources into one index (`window.MCD.DATA`):

| Source | Auth | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Public Microsoft 365 roadmap** | none | **on** | `https://www.microsoft.com/releasecommunications/api/v1/m365` — the feed behind the [public roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap). |
| **Tenant Message Center** | Microsoft Graph (app-only) | off | Your org's Message Center posts via `/admin/serviceAnnouncement/messages` (`ServiceMessage.Read.All`). |

> ⚠️ **Privacy note:** the Message Center feed is **off by default**. If you enable it, your tenant's Message Center posts are baked into `data/changes.js` and **published on your site**. Only enable it on a deployment you're comfortable making public (or keep the repo/site private).

---

## How it works

The running app is a static site — plain HTML, CSS and ES5-style vanilla JavaScript on the `window.MCD` namespace, with **no build step and zero runtime dependencies**.

1. **`data/changes.js`** defines `window.MCD.DATA` (the change index), `window.MCD.PRODUCTS` (per-product display metadata: `label`, `color`, monogram `tag`, `count`) and `window.MCD.META` (counts + build date).
2. **`js/search.js`** builds a lightweight in-memory index and answers ranked text queries (`window.MCD.search.query`).
3. **`js/app.js`** powers the dashboard (faceted sidebar, list + timeline views, detail drawer); **`js/landing.js`** powers the marketing page's live demo. Both share `js/util.js` and `js/icons.js`.
4. **`sw.js`** precaches the app shell for offline use (and serves the daily-updated `data/changes.js` network-first so returning visitors stay current).

---

## Data pipeline

The index is **generated**, not hand-edited:

```
                       (scripts)                         (output)
data/raw/roadmap.json  ── fetch-roadmap.mjs ─┐
data/raw/mc/*.json     ── fetch-mc.mjs (opt) ─┤── build-data.mjs ──▶ data/changes.js
                                              │                       window.MCD.DATA / PRODUCTS / META
```

Regenerate locally:

```bash
node scripts/fetch-roadmap.mjs   # pull the public roadmap -> data/raw/roadmap.json
node scripts/build-data.mjs      # normalize + merge -> data/changes.js
```

The build is deterministic (no network, no randomness apart from the build date), so the same inputs always produce the same `data/changes.js`.

---

## Run locally

Pure static files — any static server works:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080        # then open http://localhost:8080
# or:  npx serve .
```

No `npm install`, no bundler. (A service worker / PWA install needs a **secure context** — `https://` or `http://localhost`.)

---

## Deploy

The recommended setup is **commit → Cloudflare Pages auto-build** (no Cloudflare secrets in GitHub):

1. **Cloudflare Pages** → *Create a project* → *Connect to Git* → pick this repo.
   - Framework preset: **None**. Build command: *(empty)*. Build output directory: **`/`** (the repo root is the site).
2. **GitHub Action** (`.github/workflows/update-data.yml`) runs daily, fetches the roadmap, rebuilds `data/changes.js`, and commits it. Each push triggers a Cloudflare Pages deploy automatically.

Any other static host works too (GitHub Pages, Netlify, S3 + CloudFront) — there is no server-side logic.

### Optional: enable the tenant Message Center feed

1. Register an Entra app with the **application** Graph permission `ServiceMessage.Read.All` (grant admin consent).
2. Add repository **secrets**: `MC_TENANT_ID`, `MC_CLIENT_ID`, `MC_CLIENT_SECRET`.
3. That's it — the daily workflow's "Fetch tenant Message Center" step is a no-op without the secrets and starts merging Message Center posts once they're set. (See the privacy note above.)

Scripts load as classic `<script src>` tags in dependency order — no ES modules, no bundler for the running app.

## Tech

- **Vanilla HTML / CSS / JavaScript** — ES5-style IIFE modules on `window.MCD`, `'use strict'`. Every value reaching the DOM is escaped via `MCD.util`.
- **No framework, no build step** for the running app; the only Node usage is the offline data builder.
- **PWA** — installable, offline-capable, self-hosted Manrope font, no CDN or external requests.
- **Themes** — dark (default) and light, toggled via `<html data-theme>` and persisted in `localStorage`.
